# 1. Which country had the highest life expectancy in **1952**?

# 2. Make a plot of the life expectancy (`lifeExp`) vs. population (`pop`) in **1952**.

# 3. In the previous graph, change the color of the country depending on the continent.

# 4. Split the graph into three different groups for different gdp values.
# What are good values to split on?

# 5. Check if every country has the same number of measurements.

# 6. Show the population growth on earth over time.

# 7. Show the average life expectancy per year per continent in a graph.
