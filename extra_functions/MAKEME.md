# Extra Functions

Create a function that does a series of calculations on a starting number. The starting number is passed as an 
argument to the function. The series of calculations are passed as a dictionary, for example:

```python
calculations = {
    'add': 5,
    'multiply': 3,
    'subtract': 2,
    'divide': 4,
}
```

Finally the resulting value is returned. At least the for operations in the example should be supported.
