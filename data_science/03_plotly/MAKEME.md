- Import the plotly express library and the pandas library (we need this one for reading the data)

- Load the flights dataset using the following command: 
    
    `flights = pd.read_csv(\"../datasets/flights.csv\")`
    
- Show in a graph the distribution of the distances of the flights
- Show in a graph number of flights per origin
- Show in a graph the relationship between dep_time and arr_time
- Show in a graph the relationship between dep_delay and origin
- Show in a graph the relationship between arr_delay and dep_delay
- Show in a graph the relationship between air_time, distance and origin. **NOTE** it will be difficult to conclude something from this graph
