- Do the following exercises in a jupyter notebook
- Import the pandas, numpy and seaborn packages
- Load the diamonds dataset using the following line:

    `diamonds = sns.load_dataset("diamonds")`

- Show the distribution of the price variable in a plot
- Show in a graph the number of diamonds per cut type
- Show the relation between the `carat` and `price` only for the `fair` diamonds
- Show the relationship between the `carat` and the `price` for every `cut`
- For every `cut` of diamond calculate the following variables:
    - minimal `price`
    - maximal `price`
    - mean `price`
    - median `price`
- Show the median price per cut in a graph
- Show in a graph the `x` and `y` values of the 10 most expensive and the 10 cheapest diamonds.
- Show if there is a relation between the `color` and the `price`
