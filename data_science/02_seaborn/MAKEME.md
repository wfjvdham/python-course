- Import the seaborn library and the pandas library (we need this one for reading the data)
- Use `set()` to make the graphs a bit nicer
- Load the flights dataset using the following command: 
    
    `flights = pd.read_csv(\"../datasets/flights.csv\")`

- Show in a graph the distribution of the distances of the flights
- Show in a graph number of flights per origin
- Show in a graph the relationship between dep_time and arr_time
- Show in a graph the relationship between dep_delay and origin
- Show in a graph the relationship between month and origin
- Show in a graph the relationship between arr_delay and dep_delay
- Show in a graph the relationship between air_time, distance and origin
- Show in a graph the relationship between air_time, distance and dep_delay
