1. Pandas: this library provides the DataFrame for efficient storage and manipulation of labeled/columnar data in Python.
1. Matplotlib: this library provides capabilities for a flexible range of data visualizations in Python.
1. Scikit-Learn: this library provides efficient & clean Python implementations of the most important and established machine learning algorithms.

# IPython

> A command shell for interactive computing

```
ipython
```

`;` at the end of a line means do not show the output

`!` before a command executes that command in the system shell

# Jupyter Notebook

```
jupyter notebook
```

# Script files

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
