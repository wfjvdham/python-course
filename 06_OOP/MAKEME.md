1. Make a `person` class that contains the following attributes and functions:
      - `name` array with a first and last name
      - `age`  
      - `gender`
      - `interests` list with hobbies
      - `bio` a function that prints all the information of the person as a nicely readable string and correctly formatted
      - `greeting` a function that let the person introduce himself telling you his name
1. Replace the array in `name` by an object containing `first` and `last` and make sure your functions keep on working. 
To do this you first have to define a `name` class.
1. Create two persons with different parameters.
1. Make some Teachers class that inherits from the person class and has a `subject` as extra *Field*.
1. Give the teacher class a new `greeting` function that introduces the name and the `subject` of the teacher.
1. Create a new class Address and let all the persons and teachers have an address. Try to see if it is possible to have
 two teachers living on the same address and see what happens if one of them moves.
