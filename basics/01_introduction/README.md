**Specificity**: 
    - Be clear and specific with your instructions.
    - Longer, more detailed prompts often produce better results.
    - Delimiters can help the model separate conceptual sections of your prompt. For example, you can surround Python code with triple backticks (```).

**Context**: 
    - Give ample context on what you're trying to achieve and how.
    - Few-shot prompting means that you're adding examples of your expected output to your prompt, which provides context on what kind of response the model should produce.

**Reasoning**: 
    - Instruct the model to build complex answers incrementally instead of pushing for immediate answers.
    - Spelling out the necessary steps for completing the task helps the model correctly do tasks that would otherwise produce incorrect results.
    - Even without spelling out the steps yourself, you can often improve the results by adding a sentence that asks the model to tackle the challenge step by step.
    - When asking the model to assess whether a provided input is correct, ask the model to build its own solution first before deciding.
