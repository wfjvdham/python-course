Create a program that asks the user for his year of birth and returns the age of the user.

Asking for input for the user you can do like:

`birth_year = input('What is your year of birth?')`

Make sure your program does not crash but gives a meaningful message when:
- The input cannot be converted to an integer
- The input does not make sense in another way (negative, age not possible for humans)
